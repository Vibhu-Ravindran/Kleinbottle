Hamiltonian_terms notebook defines the lattice for various system sizes and generates Hamiltonian terms. The generated files are saved in the folder. The Exact_diagonalization notebook calculates binder ratio (fig 6) and plots the phase diagram (fig 7). It is also used to numerically verify the ground state symmetry charge and the plot the energy gaps (fig 8 in the paper).
